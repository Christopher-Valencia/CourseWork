Task 1:
    cilisp.l:
        -double token created
        -func token created
        -quit token created
        -lparen rparen tokens created

    cilisp.y:
        -all tokens add
        -all productions add
        -s_expr_section has empty reduction NOT s_expr

    cilisp.h:
        -func_type enumeration done

    cilisp.c:
        -funcNames enumeration done
        -createNumberNode done
        -createFunctionNode done
        -evalFuncNode switch statement enumerated need to create helper functions for evals
        -eval helper functions done need to test
        -TESTING:
            -all zeros for output in add and abs test case need to debug
            -fixed issue where I had the value and num type in wrond oder in cilisp.y
            -unary test ran as expected
            -had some binary test issues but were mostly fixed except pow case
            -issues to debug nested functions
            -eval funcs fixed for nested funcs EXCEPT min and max
            -eval funcs working for nested and using recursive method

Task 2:
    cilisp.h
        -typedefs have been completed as instructed

    cilist.y
        -working on the productions but having trouble with the let_list
